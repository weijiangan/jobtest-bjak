Link to demo: https://fervent-liskov-2031c9.netlify.com

This is a take-home assignment I worked on for a front end developer job interview at https://bjak.my. I was specifically requested to use HOOQ.tv's API which came in the form of the following sample snippet:
`https://cdn-discover.hooq.tv/v1.2/discover/feed?region=ID&page=1&perPage=20`

## Running
1. Refer to building instructions first
2. Run the following and you are ready to go
```sh
$ yarn start
```

## Building
```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn build
```

## Development
```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn run start:dev
```

## Testing
```sh
$ yarn test
```

## Things to note
* I only optimized responsiveness to 600px minimum since nothing is mentioned in requirements
